# BT5153 Applied Machine Learning for Business Analytics

#### <center>NUS, MSBA / Spring 2022</center>

## <font color='DarkOrange'>Content</font>

This module provides students a deep overview of various advanced machine learning techniques applied to business analytics tasks. The focus of this course will be the key and intuitive idea behind machine learning models and hands-on examples instead of theoretical analysis. The tentative topics include deep learning, unsupervised learning, machine learning system design, casual inference and explainable machine learning. The programming languages used will be Python.

### Reference Books

The following books are helpful, but not required. You will easily get these books from Internet.

- Deep Learning *Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville*
- Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective *Kevin P. Murphy*
- Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing *Christopher D. Manning and Hinrich Schütze*
- Neural Network Methods for Natural Language Processing *Yoav Goldberg*

### Quiz (10%)

During some lectures, you will be asked to take a short in-class quiz on the material from the corresponding lecture. These quizzes will be in MCQ format and displayed in google forms. Since the quize is mainly designed for attendance check, students who are not present for the quiz, and unexcused, will not be able to make up the quiz.

### Individual Assignments (45%)

There are three weekly assignments and a mini Kaggle competition. Students are expected to complete these individual tasks to gauge their understanding of the course materials so as to prepare them for their Group Project and future data science tasks. Details of the individual assignments will be updated later.

- **Credit**:
  * [Assignment 1](code/HW1.zip)  (5%)
  * [Assignment 2](code/HW2.zip) (10%)
  * [Assignment 3](code/HW3.zip) (10%)
  * Kaggle Competition (20%)

### Group Project (45%)

You are required to form a project group with 4-5 members. Students can form their own teams and please fill out the google sheets. If a student can’t find a partner, we will team you up randomly (send the email to our TAs). Your project task is to apply the data mining and machine learning techniques that you have acquired to gain insights and draw interesting conclusions to a (business) problem. You are to apply (advanced) data mining and analytics tools (preferably in Python as Python tools are used as supplementary aids during the delivery of this course) to process structured and unstructured data available on the Web. You will then summarize your insights and present your conclusions using suitable visual aids. More detailed information can be found [here](project/project.md).

- **Credit**:
  * Project proposal (10%) 
  * Project presentation (20%)
  * Project final report (15%)

### Late Policy

* You can use 2 late days, with up to 2 late days per submission including assignments and group projects.
* Once you have used all 2 late days, penalty is 25% for each additional late day.
