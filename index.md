# BT5153 Applied Machine Learning for Business Analytics

#### <center>NUS, MSBA / Spring 2024</center>

## <font color='DarkOrange'>Content</font>

This course provides a comprehensive overview of advanced machine learning techniques, focusing on practical applications in business analytics. Emphasizing intuitive understanding, it covers trending machine learning models, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Students will engage in hands-on learning, exploring feature engineering, model selection, training, and the development of end-to-end machine learning projects. For sure, the curriculum includes a special segment on Large Language Models (LLMs). Python will be the primary programming language used for instruction and project implementation. The course aims to equip students with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills for real-world challenges.

### Attendance Check (10%)

During some lectures, you will be asked to check in. It might be in-class quiz or other forms of assignments. 

### Individual Assignments (50%)

There are three weekly assignments and a mini Kaggle competition. Students are expected to complete these individual tasks to gauge their understanding of the course materials so as to prepare them for their Group Project and future data science tasks. Details of the individual assignments will be updated later.

- **Credit**:
  * Assignment 1 (10%)
  * Assignment 2 (10%)
  * Assignment 3 (10%)
  * Kaggle Competition (20%)

### Group Project (40%)

You are required to form a project group with 4-5 members. Students can form their own teams and please fill out the google sheets. If a student can’t find a partner, we will team you up randomly (send the email to our TAs). Your project task is to apply the data mining and machine learning techniques that you have acquired to gain insights and draw interesting conclusions to a (business) problem. You are to apply (advanced) data mining and analytics tools (preferably in Python as Python tools are used as supplementary aids during the delivery of this course) to process structured and unstructured data available on the Web. You will then summarize your insights and present your conclusions using suitable visual aids. More detailed information can be found [here](project/BT5153_ProjectGuidelines_Grading Criteria.pdf).

- **Credit**:
  * Project proposal (5%)
  * Project presentation (20%)
  * Project final report (15%)
