The NUS Business Analytics Centre (BAC) was established in 2013, in collaboration with IBM, to develop the skills and knowledge of professionals in business analytics. In a 5-year partnership that ensued, with IBM contributing industrial knowledge and NUS offering academic expertise, BAC offered and hosted the NUS Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) programme. Based in Singapore, students both local and international, enrolled in this master's degree programme are trained to meet the growing demand of companies who are looking to improve their operations through business analytics.


NUS Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) students are well-equipped with the expertise to excel in the data analytics field and serve a variety of industries such as retail, finance, information technology, healthcare and supply chain. To date, 300 industrial analytics projects have been accomplished by NUS MSBA students, with the institution developing valuable partnerships with over 100 organisations.
